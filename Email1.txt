Dear Studentenwerk Team,

We are a group of 3 students from Fachhochschule Kiel. As a part of our Master's curriculum we intend to perform a survey on "Problems faced by International Student's in Germany" in order to collect raw data to perform various privacy preserving techniques based on Differential Privacy.

Since this issue is addressed particularly to International students, and also contains questions regarding "Studentenwerk" we would like to request you to distribute the survey via your mailing lists.This could act as a feedback mechanism for the services provided by you.

The survey questionnaire contains questions related to 14 categories covering various stages of an International Student's journey at a University in the Federal Republic of Germany. 

It would be of great help to us if you comply with our request. We wish to hear a positive reply from you in the near future.

Thank You.Good day ahead.

Regards,
